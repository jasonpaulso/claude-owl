## What is Claude Owl?

Claude Owl is a desktop application for managing [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) configurations through an intuitive visual interface. Instead of manually editing JSON and YAML configuration files in your text editor, Claude Owl provides:

- **Visual Settings Editor** - Configure environment variables, permissions, and core settings
- **Subagents Manager** - Create, edit, and manage custom agents with system prompts and tool access
- **Skills & Plugins Manager** - Browse and manage your agent skills and plugins
- **Debug Logs Viewer** - View detailed logs from Claude Code operations
- **Hooks Manager** - View and validate your configured hooks with security insights
- **Local-First** - All configurations stay on your machine with no external data collection

## Current Features (Beta)
