# ADR-006: CI/CD and Release Automation Strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Deciders:** Engineering Team, DevOps
**Context:** Release management, branching strategy, and automated deployments for Claude Owl

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Claude Owl is an open-source Electron desktop application that requires:
1. **Multi-platform distribution** (macOS, Windows, Linux)
2. **Reliable release process** with version management and changelog generation
3. **Free hosting** for binaries (GitHub Releases)
4. **Structured branching model** for feature development, releases, and hotfixes
5. **Automated quality gates** before releases
6. **Transparent changelog** for users and contributors

**Key Challenges:**
- Building cross-platform Electron binaries requires platform-specific runners (can't build macOS on Linux)
- Manual version bumping and changelog updates are error-prone
- Need to balance automation with control (avoid accidental releases)
- Open source project requires transparent, auditable release process

---

## Decision Drivers

- **Cost:** Must use free/open-source tools and GitHub's free tier
- **Developer Experience:** Simple workflow for cutting releases
- **Quality:** All releases must pass CI pipeline (lint, typecheck, tests, build)
- **Transparency:** Clear changelog and semantic versioning
- **Multi-platform Support:** Single workflow to build all platforms
- **Security:** Code signing support (future), secure secret management
- **Community:** Standard conventions (SemVer, Conventional Commits, Keep a Changelog)

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Manual Releases with GitHub Releases
- ✅ Simple, full control
- ❌ Error-prone, manual version bumping
- ❌ Inconsistent changelogs
- ❌ Doesn't scale with contributors

### Option 2: Fully Automated with semantic-release
- ✅ Zero human intervention
- ✅ Automated versioning from commits
- ❌ Too aggressive (publishes on every merge to main)
- ❌ Less control over release timing
- ❌ Requires strict commit message discipline from all contributors

### Option 3: Semi-Automated with standard-version (CHOSEN)
- ✅ Developer triggers release with script
- ✅ Automated version bump and changelog from conventional commits
- ✅ Control over when releases happen
- ✅ Can review/edit before pushing
- ✅ Industry standard (used by Vue, Angular, etc.)

### Option 4: GitLab CI / Jenkins / CircleCI
- ❌ Additional services to maintain
- ❌ Cost (for private repos or advanced features)
- ✅ GitHub Actions is free for public repos and integrated

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Semi-automated release process with GitFlow-inspired branching strategy, GitHub Actions multi-platform builds, and standard-version for changelog generation.

---

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Types

```
main (protected)
  ↑
  └── release/v0.2.x (protected, triggers builds)
        ↑
        ├── develop (default branch, where PRs merge)
        │     ↑
        │     ├── feature/add-mcp-marketplace
        │     ├── feature/slash-commands-ui
        │     └── fix/settings-validation-bug
        │
        └── hotfix/v0.1.1-critical-security-fix (emergency only)
```

### Branch Descriptions

1. **`main`** (protected)
   - Always reflects production state
   - Only accepts merges from `release/*` or `hotfix/*` branches
   - Tagged with version numbers (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, etc.)
   - Triggers production release builds

2. **`develop`** (default branch, protected)
   - Integration branch for features
   - Where all feature PRs merge
   - CI runs on every push (lint, typecheck, tests, build)
   - Must always be in working state

3. **`release/vX.Y.x`** (protected)
   - Created from `develop` when ready for release
   - Naming: `release/v0.2.x`, `release/v1.0.x`
   - Only bug fixes allowed (no new features)
   - Merged to both `main` AND `develop` when ready
   - Triggers release candidate builds

4. **`feature/*`** (short-lived)
   - Created from `develop`
   - Naming: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/mcp-marketplace`)
   - Merged back to `develop` via PR
   - Deleted after merge

5. **`hotfix/*`** (emergency only)
   - Created from `main` for critical production bugs
   - Naming: `hotfix/vX.Y.Z-description` (e.g., `hotfix/v0.1.1-security-fix`)
   - Merged to both `main` AND `develop`
   - Increments PATCH version

### Detailed Workflow Steps

#### Step 1: Feature Development (Daily)

```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature

# Develop with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat(mcp): add marketplace browser UI"
git commit -m "fix(settings): validate permission rules before save"
git commit -m "docs: update MCP installation guide"

# Push and create PR to develop
git push -u origin feature/my-awesome-feature
# Create PR via GitHub UI → merges to develop after review
```

**Conventional Commit Types:**
- `feat:` New feature (→ MINOR version bump)
- `fix:` Bug fix (→ PATCH version bump)
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `style:` Formatting, missing semicolons
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `perf:` Performance improvement
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Build process, dependencies
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer (→ MAJOR version bump)

#### Step 2: Prepare Release (When Ready)

```bash
# Run the release preparation script
./scripts/prepare-release.sh minor  # or major, patch

# This script:
# 1. Checks out develop, pulls latest
# 2. Runs CI checks locally (lint, typecheck, tests, build)
# 3. Creates release branch (e.g., release/v0.2.x)
# 4. Runs standard-version to:
#    - Analyze commits since last release
#    - Bump version in package.json (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
#    - Generate CHANGELOG.md entries
#    - Create commit "chore(release): 0.2.0"
# 5. Pushes release branch to GitHub
# 6. Prints next steps
```

**Example Output:**
```
🚀 Release Preparation Complete!

Branch: release/v0.2.x
Version: 0.2.0
Changelog: Updated with 23 new entries

Next Steps:
1. Review CHANGELOG.md for accuracy
2. Make any final bug fixes on this branch
3. Run ./scripts/finalize-release.sh when ready to publish
```

#### Step 3: Release Candidate Testing (Optional)

```bash
# If bugs found during QA on release branch
git checkout release/v0.2.x
git commit -m "fix(ui): correct alignment in settings dialog"
git push origin release/v0.2.x

# Re-run prepare script to update changelog
./scripts/prepare-release.sh patch  # bumps to 0.2.1 if needed
```

#### Step 4: Finalize and Publish Release

```bash
# When release branch is perfect
./scripts/finalize-release.sh

# This script:
# 1. Merges release/v0.2.x → main
# 2. Tags main with v0.2.0
# 3. Pushes tag (triggers GitHub Actions build)
# 4. Merges release/v0.2.x → develop (keeps develop up to date)
# 5. Deletes release branch
# 6. Prints release URL
```

**GitHub Actions Automatically:**
1. Detects `v*` tag push
2. Runs CI pipeline (quality gates)
3. Builds macOS, Windows, Linux in parallel
4. Uploads `.dmg`, `.exe`, `.AppImage` to GitHub Releases
5. Creates draft release with auto-generated notes
6. Maintainer reviews and publishes

#### Step 5: Hotfix (Emergency Only)

```bash
# Critical security bug in production (v0.2.0)
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/v0.2.1-security-fix

# Fix the bug
git commit -m "fix(security): sanitize file paths to prevent traversal"

# Run hotfix script
./scripts/hotfix.sh

# This merges to both main and develop, tags v0.2.1
```

## Technical Implementation

### Tooling Choices

#### 1. standard-version (Changelog & Versioning)
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "standard-version": "^9.5.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "release": "standard-version",
    "release:minor": "standard-version --release-as minor",
    "release:major": "standard-version --release-as major",
    "release:patch": "standard-version --release-as patch"
  }
}
```

**Why standard-version?**
- ✅ Industry standard (Vue, Angular, Nest.js)
- ✅ Respects `CHANGELOG.md` format (Keep a Changelog)
- ✅ Integrates with conventional commits
- ✅ Allows manual control (vs semantic-release's full automation)
- ✅ Single command for version + changelog

#### 2. GitHub Actions Multi-Platform Matrix

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    include:
      - os: macos-latest
        platform: mac
        artifact: '*.dmg'
      - os: windows-latest
        platform: win
        artifact: '*.exe'
      - os: ubuntu-latest
        platform: linux
        artifact: '*.AppImage'
```

**Why matrix builds?**
- ✅ Parallel execution (faster releases)
- ✅ Platform-native builds (macOS needs macOS runner)
- ✅ Consistent environment (GitHub-hosted runners)
- ✅ Free for public repos

#### 3. GitHub Releases (Binary Hosting)

**Why GitHub Releases?**
- ✅ Free unlimited hosting for public repos
- ✅ Built-in auto-update support with electron-builder
- ✅ Version tagging integration
- ✅ Release notes from CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Download stats and community visibility

## Security Considerations

### Code Signing (Future Phase 2)

**macOS:**
```yaml
env:
  APPLE_ID: ${{ secrets.APPLE_ID }}
  APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.APPLE_PASSWORD }}
  CSC_LINK: ${{ secrets.MAC_CERT_BASE64 }}
  CSC_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.MAC_CERT_PASSWORD }}
```

**Windows:**
```yaml
env:
  WIN_CSC_LINK: ${{ secrets.WIN_CERT_BASE64 }}
  WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.WIN_CERT_PASSWORD }}
```

### Protected Branches

**Required Status Checks:**
- ✅ Lint must pass
- ✅ TypeCheck must pass
- ✅ Unit Tests must pass
- ✅ Build must succeed

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- `main`: No direct pushes, require PR review, require status checks
- `develop`: No direct pushes, require PR review, require status checks
- `release/*`: No direct pushes, require PR review

---

## Release Cadence

### Versioning Scheme (SemVer)

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)

- **MAJOR:** Breaking changes (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
  - API changes that break backward compatibility
  - Major architecture changes
  - Removal of deprecated features

- **MINOR:** New features (e.g., 0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
  - New functionality added
  - Non-breaking enhancements
  - Scheduled every 2-4 weeks

- **PATCH:** Bug fixes (e.g., 0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
  - Bug fixes
  - Security patches
  - Performance improvements
  - As needed

### Pre-Release Labels

- `v0.1.0-alpha.1` - Internal testing
- `v0.1.0-beta.1` - Public beta testing
- `v0.1.0-rc.1` - Release candidate

### Release Schedule (Recommended)

- **Minor releases:** Every 2-4 weeks (feature batching)
- **Patch releases:** As needed (bug fixes, security)
- **Major releases:** When breaking changes accumulate (6-12 months)

---

## Rollback Strategy

### If Release Build Fails

```bash
# Delete the tag
git tag -d v0.2.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.0

# Delete the release branch
git branch -D release/v0.2.x
git push origin --delete release/v0.2.x

# Fix issues on develop, then restart release process
```

### If Released Version Has Critical Bug

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/v0.2.1-critical-fix

# Fix and release as patch
./scripts/hotfix.sh
```

### If Bad Release Published

1. **Mark release as "Pre-release"** in GitHub UI (warning to users)
2. **Create hotfix** for next patch version
3. **Update release notes** with known issues
4. **Communicate** via GitHub Discussions / Discord / Twitter

---

## Success Metrics

- **Rich Documentation:** Feature showcase, installation guides, screenshots
- **SEO Benefits:** Discoverable via search engines (vs buried in releases page)
- **Community Hub:** Links to Discord, Twitter, Contributing guide

### Implementation

**Hosting:** GitHub Pages (`https://antonbelev.github.io/claude-owl/`)
- ✅ Free for public repos
- ✅ Custom domain support (optional: `claudeowl.dev`)
- ✅ HTTPS enabled by default
- ✅ 100 GB bandwidth/month
- ✅ Auto-deploys from `gh-pages` branch or `/docs` folder

**Technology Stack:**
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Static site (no build step required)
- **Tailwind CSS** - Consistent styling with main app
- **GitHub Actions** - Auto-deploy on release

**Site Structure:**
```
docs/
├── index.html              # Landing page with download buttons
├── changelog.html          # Full changelog with search/filter
├── installation.html       # Platform-specific install guides

│   └── screenshots/       # App screenshots
└── CNAME                  # Custom domain (optional)
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Intelligent Download Detection
```javascript
// Detect user's OS and show appropriate download button
const os = detectOS(); // macOS, Windows, Linux
const version = await fetch('/api/github/releases/latest').then(r => r.json());

// Show only macOS downloads initially (Phase 1)
if (os === 'macOS') {
  const arch = isMacAppleSilicon() ? 'arm64' : 'x64';
  showDownloadButton(`Claude-Owl-${version}-${arch}.dmg`);
}
```

#### 2. Live Version Display
- Fetches latest release from GitHub API
- Shows version number, release date, download count
- Links to full release notes

#### 3. Embedded Changelog

### Deployment Workflow

**Option 1: Deploy from `/docs` folder (Simpler)**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml
name: Deploy GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'docs/**'
      - 'CHANGELOG.md'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Copy changelog to docs
      - name: Update changelog
        run: cp CHANGELOG.md docs/changelog.md

      # GitHub Pages auto-deploys from /docs
      # No additional steps needed!
```

**Option 2: Build and deploy to `gh-pages` branch (More control)**
```yaml
- name: Build site
  run: |
    # Generate static HTML from templates
    npm run build:docs

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Changelog Page (`changelog.html`):**
- Renders `CHANGELOG.md` with:
  - Version badges (stable, beta, alpha)
  - Emoji icons (✨ Features, 🐛 Bug Fixes)
  - Search/filter by version or keyword
  - Direct links to GitHub commits

**Installation Page:**
- Video walkthrough of macOS installation
- FAQ: "Why does macOS show a security warning?"
- Link to issue tracker for problems

### Analytics (Optional)

**GitHub provides built-in stats:**
- Page views via GitHub Insights
- Download counts via Releases API
- Star/fork/watch metrics

**Optional: Privacy-friendly analytics**
- [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) - Open source, GDPR-compliant
- [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) - Free for open source

### SEO Optimization

```html
<!-- meta tags for search engines -->
<meta name="description" content="Claude Owl: Open-source desktop app for managing Claude Code configurations with a visual interface. macOS, Windows, Linux.">
<meta name="keywords" content="Claude Code, AI, Developer Tools, Electron, Configuration Management">

<!-- Open Graph for social sharing -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Claude Owl - Visual Claude Code Manager">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://antonbelev.github.io/claude-owl/assets/og-image.png">

<!-- Twitter Card -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
```

### Phase 1 Restrictions

**Initially (macOS-only release):**
```javascript
// Hide Windows/Linux downloads
const SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = ['macOS'];

if (!SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.includes(userOS)) {
  showMessage('Windows and Linux support coming soon! ⏳');
  showWaitlistSignup(); // Collect emails for launch notification
}
```

**Update site when multi-platform ready:**
1. Update `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS` array
2. Enable download buttons for Windows/Linux
3. Deploy via git push (auto-updates via GitHub Actions)

### Cost

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| GitHub Pages Hosting | **FREE** |
| Bandwidth (100 GB/month) | **FREE** |
| Custom Domain (optional) | $12/year |
| **Total** | **$0-12/year** |

### Success Metrics

- **Traffic:** Page views per release
- **Conversion:** Download clicks / page views
- **Engagement:** Time on site, pages per session
- **Community:** GitHub stars/forks growth after launches

⚠️ **Learning Curve:** Contributors must learn conventional commits
⚠️ **Commit Discipline:** Requires well-formed commit messages
⚠️ **Build Time:** Multi-platform builds take ~15-20 minutes (vs single platform)
⚠️ **Branch Management:** More complex than trunk-based development

### Neutral

➡️ **Semi-Manual Process:** Developer must trigger releases (not fully automated)
➡️ **GitHub Dependency:** Tightly coupled to GitHub ecosystem
➡️ **No Code Signing Yet:** Phase 1 ships unsigned binaries (macOS warnings)
